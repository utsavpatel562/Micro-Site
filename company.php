    <b style="color: blue;"><u>Zenith Electronics:</u></b>
    is an American research and development company that develops ATSC and digital rights management technologies. It is owned by the 
    South Korean company LG Electronics. Zenith was previously an American brand of consumer electronics, a manufacturer of radio and 
    television receivers and other consumer electronics, and was headquartered in Glenview, Illinois. After a series of layoffs, the 
    consolidated headquarters moved to Lincolnshire, Illinois. For many years, their famous slogan (borrowed from Crown Piano maker 
    George Bent of Chicago, used through the 1890s) was "The quality goes in before the name goes on".[2] LG Electronics acquired a 
    controlling share of Zenith in 1995; Zenith became a wholly owned subsidiary in 1999. Zenith was the inventor of subscription 
    television and the modern remote control, and was the first to develop high-definition television (HDTV) in North America.<br><br>
